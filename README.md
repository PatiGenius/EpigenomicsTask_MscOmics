# EpigenomicsTask_MscOmics

In this repository we can find the final exercises of the epigenomics assignment from the master in Omics Data Analysis (UVIC-UCC).

We perform both an ATAC-seq analysis for a single donor of ENTEx project (ENCDO451RUA) and a second analysis to assess the distal regulatory activity of two tissues: stomach and sigmoid colon. We analyze all the files belonging to GRCh38 genome assembly, containing pseudoreplicated peaks and in bigBed narrow format.
